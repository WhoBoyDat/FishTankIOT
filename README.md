This Project is using Internet Of Things (IOT) and integrate it to a fish tank. 
To access the IOT feature in this project, you must have a raspberry pi model [currently this project uses a model 3], as well as, the Telegram App
To access the Telegram bot, type in @TheFishTank_bot, however, if you were to use your own telegram channel feel free to change the telegram channel ID in the code to your respective channel ID :)
The hardware components are, one servo motor [ used as a feeder to dispense fish food, by rotating 180 degrees, and then back to original position], one DC motor [ used as a fan to cool the water temperature ], one moisture sensor, and one temperature sensor dht11
I used a public thingspeak channel which you can find in one line of code #ThingSpeak Channel ID which allows the public to access, so copy and paste the channel ID into ThingSpeak website to access the temperature graph
